# Project Description
## Project Aim
Nowadays, global warming has become a topic that even nursery kids are aware of, but still this word has been almost lost, just as its meaning. This doesn't mean that the adverse effects have also disappeared. This is where carbon emission regulations come in, supposedly in the form of carbon credits. 

This is the crux of the project, to create a regulating committee or interface so that private companies can monitor their usage, even though this might be in-voluntarily or to show and improve their CSR reports, or the government itself might facilitate the usage of such platforms to enforce proper practices. The aformentioned 'issues' have not been tackled as of with supposedly modern methods, but that is where our product shines through-

## Features
### Decentralization
The biggest obstacle that our project aims to overcome is corruption in the maintained ledgers. Blockchains are independant and 'decentralized' systems that can be accessed by anyone but modified by none. This ensures the accuracy and authenticity of the records. Also, being digital, this entirely removes the hassle of physical copies soiling and getting dirtied. As for being digital, the records are not stored on a particular server as such, but on all the 'nodes' of the blockchain. 

Following this we have choosen Ethereum as the main chain for developing the project. Further expanded below-

### IPFS Server
To completely decentralize the project, all the secondary data such as images, text also needs to be unanimously secured and saved across all nodes. This is where IPFS serves (pun intended :)), allowing data to be encrypted and access across all nodes.

### AI Interaction
With the advert of AI, systems are becoming 'person-less', with more and more tasks scheduled to computers themselves. Making good use of this fact, we have included a thorougly trained AI model, that can predict and advise on the carbon emissions produced and expected to produce based on the data given. This can, at least in theory, help organizations to predict and analyze their usage and prepare for upcoming audits.

### Carbon Credit
Probably the most important feature of the project, carbon credits exist as a system to tokenize the emission usage in the form of credits. These credits can then be traded in the marketplace among factories and producers regulated within a region to maintain their emissions and meet their production goals.
